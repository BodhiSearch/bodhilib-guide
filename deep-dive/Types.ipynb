    "# Flexible Input\n",
    "\n",
    "`bodhilib` defines a set of very flexible TypeAlias to hint at the type of inputs that can be taken by the method. \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows a method to take in various types of valid inputs, that are internally converted to a standard input format, before being processed. This approach allows extremem composability of methods, and allowing easy building of complex flows.\n",

    "## SupportsText\n",
    "SupportsText is a Python protocol. This protocol enforces a Python object to have a property `text` with a type of `str`. This way, any object that has such property can be passed whenever a SupportsText type is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SupportsText(Protocol):\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def text(self) -> str: ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the Python models conforms to SupportsText. These are - Prompt, PromptStream, Node, Document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TextLike\n",
    "\n",
    "TextLike extends the SupportsText by also including plain strings as a input type.\n",

    "TextLike: TypeAlias = Union[str, \"SupportsText\"]\n",
    "```\n",

    "## TextLikeOrTextLikeList\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## SerializedInput\n",
    "\n",
    "SerializedInput extends TextLikeOrTextLikeList by also including a serialized object as dict or a list of serialized object as dict as input type. These are handy when serialized Pydantic object are passed as input.\n",
