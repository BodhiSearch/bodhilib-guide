This guide serves as a quick introduction to bodhilib, helping you become familiar with its key features.

The primary aim of this guide is not to deep dive into the internal workings of bodhilib , but rather to offer a practical hands-on experience of interacting with various models and components, demonstrating their capabilities in generating results.

This guide has been compiled using a Jupyter Notebook, enabling you to interactively follow along. You can download the corresponding notebook from the [BodhiSearch/bodhilib-guide](https://github.com/BodhiSearch/bodhilib-guide) repository.

To execute the code, you will need API keys for OpenAI. Either have it set as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or you will be prompted to input your keys using the getpass library when necessary.
