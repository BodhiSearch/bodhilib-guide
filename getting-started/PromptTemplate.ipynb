    "# PromptTemplate\n",
    "\n",
    "PromptTemplate is used to generate dynamic prompts by injecting variables at runtime and creating parameterized prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bodhilib supports 2 ways of injecting variables using PromptTemplate -\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **fstring**\n",
    "\n",
    "    [fstring](https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/) uses the python's native string interpolation features to inject named variables. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In `fstring`, you define your named variable using single curly braces, `{` and `}`, and during variable injection, the value is replaced by the variable value passed at runtime.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    For e.g. for a fstring template - \"The {movie} is the best super-hero movie ever.\". At runtime, the `{movie}` is going to be replaced by the value of variable `movie` and produce a dynamic string to be used as prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **jinja2**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Though powerful, `fstring` is limited in its features. It cannot have `for-loops`, `if-else conditionals` etc. To overcome these limitations, bodhilib also supports [jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) as a templating engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In `jinja2` format, you define your prompt template using the [jinja2 format](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/), and then these templates are safely injected with variables at runtime to produce the dynamic prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While creating the PromptTemplate, you specify which format you want to use using the `format` parameter. Then PromptTemplate uses that templating engine to inject variables and generate the Prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it out."
